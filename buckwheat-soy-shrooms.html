				<b>Buckwheat</b> is unrealistically healthy. In recent years, the word "superfood" 
				has been used to refer to such expensive cereals as quinoa and amaranth, 
				while buckwheat is somehow forgotten. But it's forgetten for nothing. 
				See for yourself:

				<li>Slow carbs <span class="opac-text">(you'll be full for a long time)</span></li>
				<li>Low calories <span class="opac-text">(110 kcal per 100 grams of boiled

				<li>Lots of vitamins <span class="opac-text">(group B, E, PP, as well as

				<li>Essential amino acids and fiber</li>
				<li>Plenty of easily digestible vegetable protein <span class="opac-text">

						as in rice)</span></li>
				<li>Buckwheat is not a cereal, but a flower grain, so it does not contain 
						gluten</li>
				<li>In its finished form buckwheat almost does not lose its useful 
						properties <span class="opac-text">(unlike, for example, rice)</span></li>

				Already want to boil a bucket of buckwheat? But in its pure form it will 
				bore you pretty quickly. And that's where an unexpected ingredient comes 
				in — <b>soy sauce</b>!<br><br>I do not know how it happened, but the buckwheat 
				and soy sauce, like the Russian and Chinese, are brothers forever. 
				I'm sharing a simple and healthy recipe that I'm finishing up right now.

			<h2 class="headings adapts">the cooking</h2>
			<ol class="text-box text o-lists">
				<li>Prepare the ingredients. Cut onion into quarter rings, carrots into small 
						dice <span class="opac-text">(pea-size)</span>, mushrooms in half and then 
						into thin slices of 4-5 mm. 
						Boil the egg <span class="highlight">≈6 minutes</span> from water start boiling. When the egg is ready, 
						transfer it to cold water for 5-10 minutes — then it will be easier to 
						peel.<br><br></li>
				<li>On medium-high heat <span class="opac-text">(7/10 on electric stove)</span> 
						in a pot or deep frying pan, melt the butter, add 1 tablespoon of vegetable  
						oil, so that the butter does not burn, and throw the mushrooms. Fry for about 
						<span class="highlight">5 minutes</span>, stirring occasionally.<br><br>
						When the mushrooms begin to release liquid, reduce the heat to 5/10 and 
						continue to cook them, stirring <span class="highlight">every 2-3 minutes</span>. 
						They will gradually darken and decrease in size, which is what we need — 
						their flavor will enhance. When the mushrooms take on a deep dark 
						brown color — they are ready, put them away for now.<br><br></li>
				<li>Add vegetable oil to the frying pan, return the heat to 7/10. When the 
						oil is hot - send the onions to fry. It is necessary to fry slow, 
						<span class="highlight">15-20 minutes</span>, for onions to become 
						caramel brown. Stir it <span class="highlight">every 2-3 minutes</span>, 
						and if necessary, reduce the heat by 1-2 points. 
						<span class="highlight">10 minutes</span> after adding the onions 
						to the pan carrots are about to go, it should be fried with the onions for 
						<span class="highlight">5-10 minutes</span>, to your liking.<br><br></li>
				<li>Rinse buckwheat 4-5 times under running water, add it to the onion and 
						carrots, fry a little until you smell it. Then add the mushrooms back,
						pour soy sauce and water, bring to boil, cover with a lid, lower the 
						heat to low simmer and cook for <span class="highlight">15 minutes</span>. 
						Then turn off the heat, add some more butter and leave under a lid 
						for <span class="highlight">10 minutes</span>.<br><br></li>
				<li>Mix buckwheat with chopped egg, add freshly ground black pepper and 
						small chopped green onion to taste. No salt, the soy sauce is salty 
						enough as it is. Right before serving add a heaping teaspoon of
						sour cream.<br></li>
			</ol>

				You can prepare a lot at once and store in the refrigerator — just measure 
				2 parts water to 1 part dry buckwheat before cooking. The amount of other 
				ingredients increase proportionally. If you are going to cook for several 
				times — don't add the egg at once, boil a few in advance and store them 
				in the refrigerator. The same for green onions and sour cream.<br><br>
				Before serving, it's a good thought to "refresh" the buckwheat with an 
				additional couple of drops of soy sauce.<br><br>
				By the way, if you are gluten-free and therefore often eat buckwheat, 
				this recipe will also work for you, there is 
				<a href="https://www.amazon.de/s?k=gluten+free+soy+sauce" target="_blank" class="links">
				soy sauce without gluten</a> nowadays.
